Dictionaries can store a limitless amount of data, they can  be called upon, and defined to anything you wish.

Terms to know
Dictionary- a collection of key-value pairs
Key-Value Pairs- this is a key connected to a value 

Dictionaries = {call_back : Variable/value, call_back: Variable} 
ex. alien_0 = {'color':'green', 'points':5}

It is possible to add more key-value pairs to a Dictionary by using brackets 
ex. alien_0['y_position'] = 25

To make an empty Dictionary, just add braces {}
ex. dictionary = {}
